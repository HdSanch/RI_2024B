Serve in a large soup bowl with a scoop of cooked white rice, a sprinkle of green onions, and a pinch of cayenne.",30 mins,6 hrs 15 mins,6 hrs 45 mins,8,"1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed

1  smoked ham hock
2 cups water, or as needed
1 cup pickled okra, rinsed and sliced
1 pound Gulf shrimp
1 pound crawfish tail meat
1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onions (Optional)","Paso 1: Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook duck legs in hot oil, skin-side down, until browned and fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate, leaving rendered fat in the skillet.
Paso 2: Whisk 1 cup flour into fat in the skillet, adding enough oil to make a thick and smooth roux. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, until roux turns a rich, reddish-brown color, about 40 minutes. Whisk in 2 more tablespoons flour and cook for 2 minutes.
Paso 3: Whisk in broth, 1 cup at a time, until incorporated. Remove from heat.
Paso 4: Cook sausage in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in onion, peppers, celery, and chopped green onions; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in black pepper, thyme, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf, followed by diced tomatoes until combined.

Cover with a lid set at an angle to let steam out. Simmer slowly, stirring occasionally, until duck and ham hock meat are tender, about 4 hours. Skim as much fat as possible off the top as it simmers.
Paso 6: Transfer duck legs and ham hock to a large bowl and let cool. Stir pickled okra into gumbo. Pick meat from duck legs and ham hock and return meat to gumbo. Simmer gumbo for 45 more minutes.

Sprinkle 3 teaspoons Cajun seasoning into the cuts and onto the meat, then replace the skin. Whisk 1/2 cup olive oil and white wine together in a large bowl. Add chicken, spoon marinade over top, then cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Paso 2: Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering.

Paso 2: Add salt and olive oil and continue mixing with a spoon for about 3 minutes until a smooth, very soft and sticky dough forms. Clean off spoon and scrape down bowl. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.
Paso 3: Perform first set of rotating folds: leaving dough in the bowl, with a damp hand, reach under and grab the dough at the edge of the bowl, pull it and stretch it over the top. Rotate the bowl a few inches and repeat about 10 or 12 times, then gather the dough into a ball as best you can, turning the smoothest side up. Cover the bowl, and let dough rest for 15 minutes.
